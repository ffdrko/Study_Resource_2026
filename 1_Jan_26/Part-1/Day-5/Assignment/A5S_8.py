# We have defined a list in the coding area. Add some code that:

# (1) iterates over the items of mylist,

# (2) prints out the current length of the list in each iteration

mylist = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

for item in mylist:
    print(f"Current item is: {item} length of the list is : {len(mylist)}")
