# Bug-Fixing Exercise 1
# Supposedly, the following program should:

# 1. Prompt the user to input an index (e.g., 0, 1, or 2).

# 2. Print out the item with that index.

# However, there is a bug with the program which you should try to fix.



# menu = ["pasta", "pizza", "salad"]

# user_choice = input("Enter the index of the item: ")

menu = ["pasta", "pizza", "salad"]

user_choice = int(input("Enter the index of the item: "))
